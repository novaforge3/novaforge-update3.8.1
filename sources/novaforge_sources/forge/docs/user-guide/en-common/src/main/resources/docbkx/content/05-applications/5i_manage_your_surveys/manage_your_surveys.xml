    </para>
    <para>
    The current implementation of Limesurvey does not allow to deploy the automatic access management regarding the projet roles defined in the Forge.
    This restriction is mainly due to the fact that Limesurvey does not give the possibility to manage the survey permissions for a user group : 
    only the survey permissions per user is technically implemented.
    </para>
    <para>
    Consequently, any survey created by an administrator user will not be automatically visible to the other users assigned to the same Forge project.
    </para>
    <para>
    To bypass this limit, it is necessary to use the Limesurvey dedicated UI which performs the survey permission management.

    The above UI allows to modify the survey permissions for a user or for an ensemble of users ("User Group").
    </para>
    <para>
    Moreover, it is possible to detail these survey permissions after having assigned a user or a user group to a survey.
